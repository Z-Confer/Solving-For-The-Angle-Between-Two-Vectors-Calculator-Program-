# Contents
This python program is intended to be input into calculators to solve for the angle between two input vectors

# Important Notes
- The way inputs are handled, it is important to note that when inputting a vector, [2,3] is not equivalent to [2, 3]. The program will accept the former and throw an exception at the latter. Whitespace matters!!
